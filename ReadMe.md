# Ichap.

This project is still in the very rough stages of becoming a tool. The main idea is to be able to analyze a piece of the talmud in aramaic using different tools in order to assist in its study.

# where this algorithm is currently

This algorithm currently can search a text document for matching words and phrases and return either the most frequent words or the least frequent words. It uses Levenshtein Distances to remove duplicates and similiar words. As of now the word list returned is too large to be practicle for concise word study. 

The algorithm allows a teacher/tutor or talmudic studies to be able to analyze the vocabulary content of any given page to gain insigts into how best to teach it to his/her students.

# What is the Plan?

The plan of this project is manifold. However, the focus is to be an educational resource for someone trying to teach others or themselves the talmud/other jewish ancient texts. 

There is plan also to implement a better gui at some point, but that is not the most important feature since the tool itself requires a lot of work at this point.

# Feel free to contribute.
